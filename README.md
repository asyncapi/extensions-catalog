## What's an extension?

Extensions are the mechanism AsyncAPI has to allow you use custom or protocol-specific features. Extensions follow a separate release cycle and everyone can create their own. This repository is meant to contain a list of official and community supported extensions.

> Both, JSON or YAML, are supported formats. Please, take into account that only the subset of YAML that can be translated to JSON is allowed.


#### Usage in an AsyncAPI document
AsyncAPI extensions are those that are preceded by `x-`, e.g., `x-twitter`. They can be placed in the AsyncAPI document in locations specified by documentation of given extension.


## Adding your extension to the catalog

If you'd like to add your extension to the catalog, please submit a pull request to this repository. Make sure the extension doesn't exist already, in which case it would be better to improve the existing one so everybody benefits from it.
