# Contributing Extensions for AsyncAPI Specification

Extensions catalog is like a waiting room for main specification features. Goal for the extensions catalog is to enable easier and faster contribution process than you see in [AsyncAPI Specification](https://github.com/asyncapi/spec/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). 

When proposing or weighing-in on any issue or pull request, consider the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/asyncapi/.github/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
to better understand expected and unacceptable behavior.

## Guiding Principles

- Make sure that extension is well documented with good examples,
- Explain the use case,
- Try to improve existing extensions, before you contribute a competing one,
- Start discussion with an issue. Don't start with pull request first.
- Pull request with new or improved extension will be merged only if there is compliant implementation in the the [AsyncAPI JSON Schema](https://github.com/asyncapi/spec-json-schemas), [AsyncAPI JS Parser](https://www.github.com/asyncapi/parser-js) and the [AsyncAPI React component](https://github.com/asyncapi/asyncapi-react).
- You do not have to fulfil all the requirements upon pull request creation. First focus on documentation and a use case. Once maintainers of the catalog tell you that it is the right time to work on tooling implementation, then start doing it or fund volunteers that can help.
